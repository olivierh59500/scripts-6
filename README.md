Random scripts
=======

These are just random scripts I've thrown together. Will eventually sort these into individual branches.

1. Honeyport: a Bash script that listens on a port and blacklists any IP that connects to it using IPtables or Dome9 (http://www.securitygeneration.com/security/linux-bash-ncat-honeyport-script-with-iptables-and-dome9-support/)

2. PwnieScripts: The PwnieScripts set contains five bash scripts that aid in the setup of the different listeners needed when working with the various Pwnie Express PwnPlug features. These scripts were designed to be used on BackTrack 5, although they can easily be adapted to work on any other distro (http://www.securitygeneration.com/security/pwniescripts-for-pwnie-express/)
